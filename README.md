Comes with unit tests and a test window, although **the project is unfinished**.

Of most interest are

  - [Lexer.cs](SophiaLex/Lexer.cs)
  - [Parser.cs](SophiaLex/Parser.cs)

Plans
--------

  - variables (90% there)
  - tigonometry and other functions
  - assignment expressions (y =x^2 + 5*x + 3)

Speed
--------

The expression show in the above screenshot is lexed, parsed and evaluated in about 0.026 ms on a Intel i7 machine.

Why
--------

Just for fun.
